What is it?

A generic stand-alone MIPS program that can do printf on a standard UART.

requirements:

. CPU has CP0 structure (r4k compatible)

Configure:

. By default, the program is downloaded to 0xa0040000 and use a stack downward
  from 0xa0100000 (1MB).  If you want to change this change it in the 
  Makefile

. By default, the program turns off cache in kernel mode (CP0_CONFIG).

. Change uart16550.c file to use the right parameters for the serial port.

. Make sure you have the right prefix for cross tools

Make:

. 'make elf' - make barebone.elf, an ELF image
. 'make srec'  - S-record image
. 'make bin'  - binary image
. 'make' - make all three iamges
. 'make clean'

Test:

You can link with test.c file and do some uart and printf testing.
