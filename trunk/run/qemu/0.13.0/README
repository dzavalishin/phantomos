Kernel and small root FS for use with qemu ARM emulation.

The kernel config is included in the kernel.  It can be extracted from the
image with linux/scripts/extract-ikconfig or accessed as /proc/config.gz
on a running kenel.

The root FS should be loaded as an initrd.  eg:

./qemu-system-arm -kernel zImage.integrator -initrd arm_root.img

Or without graphical output:

./qemu-system-arm -kernel zImage.integrator -initrd arm_root.img -nographic -append "console=ttyAMA0"
